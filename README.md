* **ArrayQueue** - queue made with a closed circle array  
* **ArrayStack** - stack made with a dynamic array  
* **LinkedList** - doubly linked list with sentinel node  
* **LinkedQueue** - doubly linked queue with sentinel node  
* **LinkedStack** - doubly linked stack with sentinel node  
* **BinTree** - binary tree made with pointers (to child and parent nodes)  
* **Tree** - n-ary tree made with pointers (to child, sibling and parent nodes)  
* **Dictionary** - dynamic hash table made with separate chaining using linked lists  
* **PriorityQueue** - priority queue made with a dynamic heap  
* **Graph** - graph made with a dynamic array of adjacency lists  
  
These files have been compiled with GCC 6.3.0 (MinGW) with the options `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic-errors`  
and debugged with gdb, but they haven't been tested thoroughly, so there may still be some bugs.
